The pandemic as well as other illness, weather-related closures, and staffing limitations have contributed greatly towards the overall blood donation decline. The Red Cross, which supplies 40% of the nation’s blood supply, has had to limit blood product distributions to hospitals as a result of the shortage. In fact, some hospitals may not receive 1 in 4 blood products they need. Blood cannot be manufactured or stockpiled and can only be made available through the kindness of volunteer donors. Find out if you are eligible to give blood or find a donation site near you today!",

            "There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed.", 
            "Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions."
