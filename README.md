### Product Vision Statement
People use apps and websites to connect with others, find furniture, restaurants, clothes, and other things that they need. The same technology can be used to create a centralized place to find blood donation centers and drives to help stop the shortage.

### What and why?
Since the pandemic started blood donations have decreased by 10% and as of December 2021 the US blood supply is at its lowest level in a decade. The inventory of some blood types has dropped below one day’s supply in recent weeks, which is a dangerously low level. Despite the consistent demand for blood in healthcare, only about 3% of age-eligible people donate blood yearly. Additionally, many people aren't aware of whether or not they're even eligible to donate in the first place. Having a centralized app to not only fine blood donation centers, but also answer FAQs and find out about donation eligibility could increase the percentage of people who donate blood yearly.

### For whom?
* People who are interested in learning more about blood donation and people who are interested in donating blood. 
* The public will be able to determine their eligibility and can find the nearest blood bank or blood drive.
* We can treat blood banks/drives as users as well, depending on what the final form of the app looks like and aims to achieve. 

### How?
Opening the website for the first time you will be brought to the hompage with links to a Map page, FAQ page, Profile page, and a Contact Us page.  

When clicking on the Map page, a user will be shown blood donation centers and drives close to them. They will also have the option to put in an address or zipcode. From there they can select where they would like to go to donate blood. This action triggers an initial onboarding process to determine the user's eligibility based on factors such as age, weight, and current health. The first question will be “What type of donation will you be making (Whole Blood Donation, Power Red Donation, Platelet Donation)”, then depending on the answer there will be some follow up questions to see if they are eligible. The user's account will be marked with Eligible or Ineligible.

If the user is eligible, they will brought over to that location’s website to make an appointment.

If a user is not eligible they will be brought to a page that lists other ways that they can help. They will still be able to access all other features of the app, including the map, but will be faced with a pop-up message if they select a blood bank or drive.

Additional features on the app include a general FAQ page.
