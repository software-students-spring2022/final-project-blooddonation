# Guide to Contributing
## Team Norms 

**Our Standards**
Our team aims to foster an open and welcoming environment, where every individual feels comfortable participating in 
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Be respectful of different viewpoints 
- Be empathetic towards each other  
- Openly communicate and resolve any issues between teammates 

## Git Workflow
**Pull Request Process**
- All pull requests should be sent to the "develop" branch
- The "develop" branch is where the version planned for release after a sprint will be stored 
- Pull requests should **only contain one change**; If you have multiple changes to submit, submit changes into their own branch on your fork 
- You may merge the pull request after you have a sign-off from two other developers
